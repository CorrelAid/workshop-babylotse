Auch viele Haltestellen, z. B. der Westbahnhof, Gehwege oder generell \u00dcberg\u00e4nge sind oft immer noch nicht barrierefrei. Auch Zebrastreifen sind oft nicht vorhanden oder an v\u00f6llig falschen Stellen, um sicher \u00fcber die Stra\u00dfe zu kommen. Das macht den Alltag und auch viele Ausfl\u00fcge oft sehr umst\u00e4ndlich. Auch das Thema Kita-Platz ist ein riesen gro\u00dfes Problem!!! Ich habe vor der Elternzeit selbst im P\u00e4dagogischen Bereich gearbeitet und wei\u00df um die oft schlimmen Zust\u00e4nde in den Einrichtungen. Das offene Konzept ist auch ein gro\u00dfes Problem und das h\u00e4lt keine Fachkraft bei dem Personal Mangel lange durch. Auch die Aufmerksamkeit einzelner Kinder mit mehr Bedarf zu beobachten und individuell die Kinder zu f\u00f6rdern, geht komplett verloren. Ich habe auch wenig Hoffnung einen Kita Platz f\u00fcr mein Kind zu bekommen und wenn ja mich darauf zu verlassen, dass mein Kind in einer Kita gut aufgehoben/betreut ist, da die meisten Einrichtungen einfach st\u00e4ndig unterbesetzt sind . Es w\u00e4re auch sch\u00f6n mehr Treffpunkte im Stadtteil zu haben z.B Eltern-Kind-Caf\u00e9s oder Babytreffs. Ausserdem kann ich nicht verstehen warum man alle Daten und Anmeldungen im Kindernet wieder komplett neu eingeben muss und diese nicht einfach vom alten ins neue \u00fcbertragen werden k\u00f6nnen?\r\nIch hoffe auch sehr, das sich zum Thema Bahnhofsviertel bald mal etwas zum positiven bewegt.\r\nFrankfurt ist generell eine Familien freundlich Stadt aber es ist auf jeden Fall noch viel Luft nach oben!"}], "temperature": 0}}
